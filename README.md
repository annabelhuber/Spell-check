# Creating an Adaptive Spell Check

The full write up for this project is linked below, but the synopsis is that I wrote an algorithm to check spelling in a given document by comparing it to the dictionary and suggesting the words with the least distance from the original, misspelled word. The second part of this project was to feed the algorithm a supporting document so when it offers suggestions, they're based on how often the supporting document used the target words. 

This was done for an Analysis of Algorithms class at Colby College.
